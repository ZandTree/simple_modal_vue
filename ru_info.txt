project based on vue.js 3
possible bugs:
1.don't place condition inside <teleport>
source of bugs
<teleport to="...">
    <div v-if="showSignUp">
        <Modal> component

2. control of teleported elems will be not from 
index.html but from App.vue(Modal.vue as a child component)

3.css for modal should be not scoped
otherwise you need to put them in App.vue(parent)
